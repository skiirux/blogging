                Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.[1] Hendrix expanded
                the range and vocabulary
                of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. His boundless drive, technical
                ability
                and creative application of such effects as distortion forever transformed the sound of rock and roll.
                While
                creating his unique musical voice and guitar style, Hendrix synthesized diverse genres, including blues,
                R&B, soul, British rock, American folk music, 1950s rock and roll, psychedelic and jazz. Hendrix favored
                overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain.[119] He was instrumental in developing the previously
                undesirable
                technique of guitar amplifier feedback, and helped to popularize use of the wah-wah pedal in mainstream
                rock.[348]
                He rejected the standard barre chord fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the
                low 6th string root notes with his thumb.[349] He applied this technique during the beginning bars of
                "Little
                Wing", which allowed him to sustain the root note of chords while also playing melody. This method has
                been
                described as piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist's left hand would play and the other
                fingers
                playing melody as a right hand.[350] Having spent several years fronting a trio, he developed an ability
                to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio impression that more than one guitarist
                was
                performing.[351][nb 41] He was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic phasing effects in rock
                music
                recordings.[354] Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented: "Hendrix pioneered the use of the
                instrument
                as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but
                Hendrix
                turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues
                with
                which he began."[3][nb 42] Aledort wrote: "In rock guitar, there are but two eras ï¿½ before Hendrix and
                after
                Hendrix."
